# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BeeStream Platform Expansion transforms the existing music streaming platform into a comprehensive decentralized media ecosystem with three major new capabilities:

1. **Pay-per-Use Media CDN with Verifiable Origin** - External API for websites to embed and stream BeeStream content with usage-based billing
2. **Time-stamped Creative Registry (NFT + Verifiable File Storage)** - NFT marketplace for music with proof of creation and ownership
3. **Verifiable Data Escrow** - Legal compliance module for tamper-proof document storage

This expansion leverages the existing Filecoin storage infrastructure, Synapse SDK integration, and USDFC payment system while adding new revenue streams and use cases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pay-per-Use Media CDN API

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to embed BeeStream music tracks on my site with automatic usage billing, so that I can provide verified music content while paying only for actual streams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer requests API access THEN the system SHALL provide API keys with configurable rate limits and billing tiers
2. WHEN an external site embeds a track THEN the system SHALL serve content through CDN endpoints with verifiable origin proofs
3. WHEN content is streamed THEN the system SHALL track usage metrics including play count, duration, and geographic location
4. WHEN billing periods end THEN the system SHALL automatically charge API users based on bandwidth and stream counts using USDFC
5. WHEN content is served THEN the system SHALL include cryptographic proofs of file integrity and Filecoin storage verification
6. IF API limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL throttle requests and notify users of upgrade options
7. WHEN artists opt-in THEN the system SHALL share CDN revenue with content creators automatically

### Requirement 2: NFT Creative Registry

**User Story:** As a music artist, I want to mint NFTs for my uploaded tracks with verifiable timestamps, so that I can prove ownership and sell limited editions of my music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an artist uploads music THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a proof-of-creation timestamp using blockchain verification
2. WHEN an artist chooses to mint NFTs THEN the system SHALL create ERC-721 tokens linked to the Filecoin-stored music files
3. WHEN NFTs are minted THEN the system SHALL include metadata with PDP proofs, creation timestamps, and file integrity hashes
4. WHEN NFTs are listed THEN the system SHALL provide a marketplace interface for buying, selling, and trading music NFTs
5. WHEN NFT sales occur THEN the system SHALL automatically distribute royalties to artists using smart contracts
6. WHEN buyers purchase NFTs THEN the system SHALL provide verifiable proof of ownership and access to high-quality files
7. IF ownership disputes arise THEN the system SHALL provide cryptographic proof of original creation and ownership chain

### Requirement 3: Verifiable Data Escrow Module

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want to store sensitive documents with the same verifiable infrastructure as BeeStream music, so that I can create tamper-proof evidence for legal proceedings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legal documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL create separate escrow datasets isolated from music content
2. WHEN documents are stored THEN the system SHALL generate immutable audit trails with timestamps and PDP verification
3. WHEN access is requested THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions and document access controls
4. WHEN verification is needed THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable certificates with cryptographic proofs
5. WHEN retention periods are set THEN the system SHALL automatically manage document lifecycle and notify before expiration
6. IF court orders are received THEN the system SHALL support legal discovery processes with proper documentation
7. WHEN billing occurs THEN the system SHALL use separate pricing tiers for legal vs. entertainment content

### Requirement 4: Unified Platform Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage all three services from a single dashboard, so that I can monitor performance, billing, and compliance across the entire ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display unified metrics for music streaming, CDN usage, NFT sales, and escrow services
2. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL track Filecoin storage provider status across all service types
3. WHEN managing billing THEN the system SHALL provide consolidated invoicing and revenue reporting for all platform services
4. WHEN compliance audits occur THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports covering all stored content types
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support independent scaling of music, CDN, NFT, and escrow services
6. IF issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide service-specific alerting and diagnostic tools
7. WHEN users need support THEN the system SHALL route tickets based on service type (music, CDN, NFT, or escrow)

### Requirement 5: Developer Integration Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive APIs and SDKs for all BeeStream services, so that I can easily integrate music streaming, NFT functionality, and document escrow into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers register THEN the system SHALL provide unified API documentation covering all service endpoints
2. WHEN integrating CDN services THEN the system SHALL offer JavaScript, React, and REST API options with code examples
3. WHEN working with NFTs THEN the system SHALL provide Web3 integration guides and smart contract interfaces
4. WHEN implementing escrow features THEN the system SHALL offer compliance-focused SDK with legal workflow examples
5. WHEN testing integrations THEN the system SHALL provide sandbox environments for all services
6. IF rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL provide clear upgrade paths and pricing information
7. WHEN seeking support THEN the system SHALL offer developer-specific documentation and community forums

### Requirement 6: Cross-Service Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want assurance that all content across music, NFTs, and legal documents maintains the same high level of verification, so that I can trust the platform for any use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any content is stored THEN the system SHALL use consistent PDP verification across all service types
2. WHEN data integrity is questioned THEN the system SHALL provide unified verification tools for any stored content
3. WHEN content is accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs with the same standards across all services
4. WHEN backups are needed THEN the system SHALL ensure all content types have equivalent disaster recovery capabilities
5. WHEN migrations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity proofs during any system updates
6. IF storage providers fail THEN the system SHALL have consistent failover procedures for all content types
7. WHEN compliance is audited THEN the system SHALL demonstrate equivalent security standards across all services

### Requirement 7: Revenue and Billing Integration

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want transparent revenue tracking and automated billing across all platform services, so that I can understand profitability and scale the business effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN revenue is generated THEN the system SHALL track earnings separately for streaming, CDN, NFT, and escrow services
2. WHEN artists earn money THEN the system SHALL distribute payments from all revenue sources (streaming, CDN, NFT royalties)
3. WHEN API customers are billed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed usage breakdowns and cost predictions
4. WHEN NFT sales occur THEN the system SHALL handle marketplace fees, artist royalties, and platform commissions automatically
5. WHEN escrow services are used THEN the system SHALL bill based on storage duration and verification frequency
6. IF payment issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide service-specific grace periods and resolution workflows
7. WHEN financial reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive revenue reports across all service lines
