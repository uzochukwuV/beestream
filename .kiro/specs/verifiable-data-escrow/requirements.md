# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Verifiable Data Escrow feature transforms the existing BeeStream platform into a comprehensive solution for legal and compliance teams who need tamper-proof document storage with cryptographic verification. This feature leverages Filecoin's Proof of Data Possession (PDP) capabilities through the Synapse SDK to create immutable on-chain escrow records, provide verifiable timestamps, and generate downloadable audit logs for legal proceedings and compliance requirements.

The system will enable law firms, compliance teams, and forensic services to upload sensitive documents with cryptographic guarantees of integrity, creating an immutable chain of custody that can be verified by any party with access to the blockchain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want to upload sensitive documents to a verifiable escrow system, so that I can create tamper-proof evidence with cryptographic verification for legal proceedings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL create a PDP-backed storage deal on Filecoin with cryptographic proof of possession
2. WHEN a document is stored THEN the system SHALL generate an immutable on-chain escrow record with timestamp and file hash
3. WHEN a storage deal is created THEN the system SHALL provide a unique escrow ID that can be used for future verification
4. IF a document upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback any partial transactions
5. WHEN a document is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display confirmation with escrow ID, transaction hash, and PDP proof details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to verify the integrity and authenticity of escrowed documents, so that I can ensure data has not been tampered with since the original upload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an escrow ID THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the original document metadata and verification status
2. WHEN verification is requested THEN the system SHALL check PDP proofs against the Filecoin network to confirm data possession
3. WHEN PDP verification completes THEN the system SHALL display proof status, storage provider information, and blockchain confirmation details
4. IF verification fails THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the failure reason and provide troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable verification certificate with cryptographic proofs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a forensic investigator, I want to generate comprehensive audit logs for escrowed documents, so that I can provide complete chain of custody documentation for legal proceedings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audit log is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report including all document interactions and verifications
2. WHEN generating audit logs THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, transaction hashes, PDP proof details, and verification history
3. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable PDF format with cryptographic signatures for authenticity
4. WHEN multiple documents are involved THEN the system SHALL support batch audit log generation for case management
5. WHEN audit logs are downloaded THEN the system SHALL record the download event in the blockchain for complete transparency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a law firm administrator, I want to manage access permissions and billing for escrow services, so that I can control who can upload documents and track usage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to upload documents THEN the system SHALL verify wallet permissions and available USDFC balance for escrow fees
2. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL provide transparent pricing for storage duration, PDP verification, and audit log generation
3. WHEN payment is processed THEN the system SHALL use USDFC stablecoin for predictable billing without cryptocurrency volatility
4. IF insufficient funds are available THEN the system SHALL prevent upload and display required deposit amount
5. WHEN escrow services are used THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed billing records accessible through the dashboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a document owner, I want to set retention periods and access controls for escrowed documents, so that I can comply with legal requirements and data protection regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom retention periods from 1 year to 99 years
2. WHEN retention periods are set THEN the system SHALL calculate and display total storage costs upfront
3. WHEN access controls are configured THEN the system SHALL support wallet-based permissions for document viewing and verification
4. WHEN retention periods expire THEN the system SHALL notify document owners and provide options for extension or secure deletion
5. IF documents need emergency access THEN the system SHALL support court-ordered access with proper legal documentation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor escrow system health and performance, so that I can ensure reliable service for critical legal documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL track PDP verification success rates and storage provider availability
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL automatically alert administrators and provide diagnostic information
3. WHEN storage providers go offline THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic failover to backup providers when possible
4. WHEN system maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL provide advance notice to users and maintain service availability
5. WHEN compliance audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logs and metrics for regulatory review
