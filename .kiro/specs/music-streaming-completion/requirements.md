# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Music Streaming Completion feature completes the core BeeStream functionality by implementing the missing database layer and API endpoints. Currently, users can upload music packages (audio + metadata) to Filecoin via Synapse SDK, but there's no way to store metadata in a database for browsing, searching, and streaming. 

This implementation will create the complete flow: **Upload to Filecoin → Store metadata in database → Display music for streaming**.

The system will maintain the existing Filecoin storage architecture while adding a traditional database layer for fast queries and user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Music Metadata Database Storage

**User Story:** As a music artist, I want my uploaded music metadata to be stored in a database after Filecoin upload, so that listeners can discover and stream my music through the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a music package is successfully uploaded to Filecoin THEN the system SHALL extract metadata from the ZIP and store it in the database
2. WHEN storing metadata THEN the system SHALL save track_name, artist_name, artist_address, category, duration, and piece_cid from the Filecoin upload
3. WHEN cover images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store the cover_photo_url for display in the music browser
4. WHEN gradient colors are selected THEN the system SHALL save the gradient_colors object for UI theming
5. WHEN database storage completes THEN the system SHALL return a unique music submission ID to the user
6. IF database storage fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but keep the Filecoin upload intact for retry
7. WHEN metadata is stored THEN the system SHALL automatically set created_at and updated_at timestamps

### Requirement 2: Music Discovery API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to browse, search, and filter music tracks, so that I can discover new music and find specific songs or artists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing music THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints to fetch paginated music submissions with sorting options
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support text search across track_name, artist_name, and category fields
3. WHEN filtering THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by category, artist_address, and date ranges
4. WHEN requesting music details THEN the system SHALL return complete metadata including piece_cid for Filecoin retrieval
5. WHEN sorting results THEN the system SHALL support sorting by created_at, track_name, artist_name, and play counts
6. IF no results are found THEN the system SHALL return empty arrays with appropriate HTTP status codes
7. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with helpful messages

### Requirement 3: Music Streaming Integration

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to stream music directly from Filecoin storage, so that I can listen to tracks while ensuring artists maintain ownership of their content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a track THEN the system SHALL retrieve the piece_cid from the database and fetch audio from Filecoin
2. WHEN streaming begins THEN the system SHALL use the existing Synapse SDK download functionality to serve audio content
3. WHEN audio is served THEN the system SHALL support standard web audio formats and streaming protocols
4. WHEN tracks are played THEN the system SHALL record play statistics including listener_address and play_duration
5. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and clear error messages to users
6. IF Filecoin retrieval is slow THEN the system SHALL show loading states and progress indicators
7. WHEN multiple users stream THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access to the same Filecoin content

### Requirement 4: Upload Flow Integration

**User Story:** As a music artist, I want the upload process to seamlessly save my music to both Filecoin and the database, so that my tracks are immediately available for streaming after upload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Filecoin upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger database metadata storage
2. WHEN extracting metadata THEN the system SHALL parse the metadata.json file from the uploaded ZIP package
3. WHEN saving to database THEN the system SHALL use the wallet address from the connected user as artist_address
4. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL redirect users to their music dashboard showing the new track
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which step failed (Filecoin vs database)
6. IF database storage fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual retry without re-uploading to Filecoin
7. WHEN retrying THEN the system SHALL use the existing piece_cid to avoid duplicate Filecoin uploads

### Requirement 5: Music Analytics and Statistics

**User Story:** As a music artist, I want to track how my music is performing, so that I can understand my audience and optimize my content strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracks are played THEN the system SHALL record play events with timestamps and listener information
2. WHEN users like tracks THEN the system SHALL store like events linked to user wallet addresses
3. WHEN artists view analytics THEN the system SHALL display total plays, likes, and unique listeners per track
4. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL provide breakdowns by time periods (today, week, month, year)
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL show trending tracks and artist performance metrics
6. IF analytics data is missing THEN the system SHALL show zero values rather than errors
7. WHEN privacy is required THEN the system SHALL allow anonymous play tracking without wallet addresses

### Requirement 6: Database Schema and Performance

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want efficient database queries and proper indexing, so that the music platform can scale to thousands of tracks and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the database THEN the system SHALL implement proper indexes on frequently queried fields (artist_address, category, created_at)
2. WHEN storing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use appropriate data types and constraints for optimal performance
3. WHEN querying music THEN the system SHALL implement pagination to handle large result sets efficiently
4. WHEN relationships exist THEN the system SHALL use foreign keys to maintain data integrity between tables
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support database connection pooling and query optimization
6. IF database performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting capabilities
7. WHEN backups are required THEN the system SHALL implement automated backup strategies for data protection

### Requirement 7: API Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want secure API endpoints with proper validation, so that my data is protected and the platform remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing APIs THEN the system SHALL validate wallet signatures for write operations
2. WHEN submitting data THEN the system SHALL validate all input fields against defined schemas
3. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate limits to prevent abuse
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL sanitize error messages to prevent information leakage
5. WHEN logging requests THEN the system SHALL log API usage for monitoring and debugging
6. IF malicious requests are detected THEN the system SHALL implement blocking and alerting mechanisms
7. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices for data protection
